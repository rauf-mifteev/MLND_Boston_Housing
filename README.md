# Housing Prices Prediction Project for Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

## Project overview
This is Boston housing prices predicting project. In this project, I used **SciKit-learn** to apply basic **machine learning** concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. 
* First, I explored the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. 
* Next, I split the data into testing and training subsets, and determined a suitable performance metric for this problem. 
* Then, I analyzed performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. 
* This allowed me to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. 
* Finally, I tested this optimal model on a new sample and compared the predicted selling price to statistics.

## Prerequisites
The code is **Python** in a **Jupyter Notebook** and it uses:
* [SciKit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) 
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)

You can install everything you need to run this project with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).
